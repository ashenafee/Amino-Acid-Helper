# Amino-Acid-Helper

*A project meant to learn the basics of Java, and help with life science courses.*

## How does it work?

You input your amino acid sequence, and it can be in one of the following forms (and hit ENTER):

| Type          | Example                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Single letter | ASH                                   |
| Short-form    | Ala Ser His                           |
| Full name     | Alanine Serine Histidine              |

You will be given the following information regarding your sequence:

- Single-letter name
- Three-letter name
- Full name
- Charge
- Polarity

### Example Usage

## What's next?

As of now, this project was created with easing the load of BCH210 in mind, but doubled as a way to learn the basics of Java.

For the future, I might look to add functionality which will allow for:

- [ ] A GUI
- [ ] Filtering information based off certain environmental factors (e.g. pH)
- [ ] Returning images of the amino acids involved in the sequence (at physiological pH)
